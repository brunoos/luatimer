 Building
----------
LuaTimer is composed by two parts:
  * C part: to get the OS time in milliseconds.
  * Lua part: all the rest.

To build the C part you should compile the C part accord your system:

(i) Linux, *BSD, and Mac OS X
  1.  Go to 'unix' directory. 

  2.  Edit 'Makefile' and  set LUAINC with the path for your Lua 5.1 headers.

  2.1 Under Mac OS X, also set the MACOSX_VERSION according your system.

  3. Use the command 'make' (or 'gmake') and the target system:
         make linux
      or
         make bsd
      or
         make macosx
 
(ii) Windows
  1. Open the project for Visual C++ in the 'windows' directory.
  
  2. Set the location of Lua DLL and Lua headers in the project properties.

 Intalling
-----------

from the 'lua' directory to some place in your LUA_PATH.
